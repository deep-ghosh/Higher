## 🌟 Vision: The Future of Content is Creator-Owned

**Higher revolutionizes digital publishing with one core principle:** creators should fully own their content, not platforms.

Our decentralized ecosystem ensures your content lives on the blockchain, remains permanently accessible, and can be monetized without intermediaries taking a cut. Higher isn't just another platform—it's a movement toward true content sovereignty.
